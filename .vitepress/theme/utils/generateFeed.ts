// body containing the sequence twice would prematurely close the section and
// corrupt the whole feed document. Neutralize every terminator by
// entity-encoding its closing bracket; since `content:encoded` is HTML, a
// spec-compliant reader decodes it back to the original literal text (a
// plaintext-mode reader would show `]]&gt;`, an acceptable trade for not
// breaking the document).
